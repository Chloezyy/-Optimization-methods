In this project, we implemented three optimization methods for
extreme value in python, including the golden section Method, Powell's Method and
Down-Hill Simplex Method. We test functions of different dimensions in these three
algorithms. It is found that in one-dimensional function, the golden section Method is
the most efficient, and in multi-dimensional function, Powell's method is faster. The
advantage of the Down-Hill Simplex Method is that it can find the global extreme
value without manually setting the initial point.
